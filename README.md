# Vizor

Vizor is a self-custody Zcash wallet for shielded ZEC, with a polished desktop
experience built around clarity, privacy, and ease of use. It is for users who
want to create, receive, shield, and send ZEC without giving a hosted wallet
service control over their funds.

Official public releases currently focus on signed and notarized macOS DMGs.

## Features

- Create or import a Zcash wallet.
- Use a clean, modern interface designed to make shielded Zcash easier to use.
- Receive to shielded Unified Addresses or transparent addresses.
- Send ZEC from shielded balance.
- Add memos when sending to shielded recipients.
- Shield funds received to a transparent address.
- Use multiple accounts in one wallet.
- Import Keystone hardware wallet accounts.
- Choose from preset or custom lightwalletd endpoints.
- View balances, sync progress, and transaction history in a focused desktop
  UI.
- Protect local access with an app password and privacy mode.

## Relay feedback experiment

The `experiment/relay-wallet-api` branch adds optional relay observations to
send receipts and pending transaction details on desktop and mobile. It is a
research integration. Build without `VIZOR_RELAY_API_URL` to disable it.

To try it against an already established local tunnel to the observer API:

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run -d macos \
  --dart-define=ZCASH_DEFAULT_NETWORK=main \
  --dart-define=VIZOR_RELAY_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18790/v1/forecast
```

Alternatively configure the full `/v1/forecast` URL of a trusted HTTPS service.
Only HTTPS and numeric loopback HTTP endpoints are accepted. This build does
not create a tunnel, expose the observer publicly, or deploy a service. Tor
mode continues to use Tor and fails closed; a local tunnel is not reachable
through a remote Tor exit. Use a reachable HTTPS service for Tor testing.

On an unlocked send receipt or pending activity screen, choose **Enable relay
feedback**. Consent lasts for the app session and resets on lock or account
change. **Stop relay feedback** turns it off. Requests contain only the network
and display-order transaction ID; the service can still associate requests and
see the connection IP unless Tor is in use. No addresses, amounts, memos, wallet
identifiers, keys, or telemetry are sent by this feature.

The panel distinguishes not yet observed, seen, inclusion reported, expiry
reported, and unavailable. Only the wallet confirms transactions and decides
spendability. Every ID in a multi-transaction send is tracked independently.
Numerical estimates require the API to explicitly report a validated,
non-synthetic, non-shadow model with a valid cumulative distribution; the
current research/shadow responses therefore show observations without
percentages. No arrival-time countdown or expiry prediction is invented.

Polling is shared across views of the same transaction, starts after the send
runner returns its broadcast result, and stops while the app is backgrounded,
the route is covered, the account is locked/switched, or the wallet reports the
transaction mined/expired. Wallet reorgs can resume tracking. Each visible watch
lasts at most one hour; requests time out after three seconds, start at one-second
intervals, settle to five seconds, and back off to fifteen seconds after errors.
This version does not establish a 100 ms broadcast-to-feedback latency claim.

Focused checks:

```bash
fvm flutter test test/features/relay_feedback \
  test/features/send/send_status_screen_test.dart \
  test/features/activity/activity_transaction_status_screen_test.dart
fvm flutter test --tags mobile --run-skipped \
  --dart-define=VIZOR_FORM_FACTOR=mobile \
  test/features/send/mobile_send_status_screen_test.dart \
  test/features/activity/mobile_transaction_status_screen_test.dart \
  test/core/widgets/mobile/mobile_transaction_progress_screen_test.dart
```

## Build From Source

Use the release tag that matches the DMG you want to verify:

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout release/vX.Y.Z
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Make sure the commit matches the GitHub release, then build:

```bash
fvm install
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter build macos --release \
  --dart-define=ZCASH_DEFAULT_NETWORK=main \
  --dart-define=VIZOR_COINGECKO_PRICE_BASE_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3
```

For testnet:

```bash
fvm flutter build macos --release \
  --dart-define=ZCASH_DEFAULT_NETWORK=test
```

`VIZOR_COINGECKO_PRICE_BASE_URL` controls the home screen ZEC price and 24h
change source. Open-source builds should use the public CoinGecko base URL
above; production builds can point this define at a Vizor-operated proxy.

The built app is at:

```text
build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Vizor.app
```

Local builds may not use the same Apple signing identity as the official
release. That is expected. The goal is to verify the source and behavior, not
to produce a byte-for-byte identical app.

## Package a Local DMG

```bash
mkdir -p dist/macos

scripts/package-macos-release-dmg.sh \
  --app-path build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Vizor.app \
  --output dist/macos/Vizor-local-macos.dmg
```

The DMG packaging script must run on macOS in a GUI session.

## Verify an Official DMG

Check the hash:

```bash
shasum -a 256 Vizor-macos.dmg
```

Then verify Apple signing and notarization:

```bash
DMG="Vizor-macos.dmg"

spctl --assess --type open --context context:primary-signature -vv "$DMG"
xcrun stapler validate "$DMG"

hdiutil attach "$DMG" -readonly
APP="/Volumes/Install Vizor Wallet/Vizor.app"

codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "$APP"
codesign -dv --verbose=4 "$APP" 2>&1 | egrep 'Identifier|TeamIdentifier|Authority'
spctl --assess --type execute -vv "$APP"
xcrun stapler validate "$APP"

hdiutil detach "/Volumes/Install Vizor Wallet"
```

Expected mainnet identity:

```text
Identifier=com.keplr.vizor
TeamIdentifier=SZTB68DXM4
Authority=Developer ID Application: Chainapsis Inc. (SZTB68DXM4)
```

For testnet, the app path and identifier are:

```text
/Volumes/Install Vizor Testnet Wallet/Vizor Testnet.app
Identifier=com.keplr.vizor.testnet
TeamIdentifier=SZTB68DXM4
```

## Notes

- Back up your mnemonic. Vizor cannot recover funds if you lose it.
- The local password protects this device only. It does not replace the
  mnemonic backup.
- Shielded transactions are scanned locally, but your lightwalletd endpoint can
  still see network metadata such as IP address and request timing.
- Transparent Zcash addresses and transactions are public on-chain.
- Some exchanges only support transparent withdrawals. Shield those funds after
  they arrive.
- Sending uses shielded balance. Transparent funds must be shielded first.
- Local rebuilds are not expected to match the official DMG byte-for-byte
  because Apple signing, notarization, timestamps, and DMG metadata differ.

## Development

```bash
fvm flutter run
fvm flutter test
fvm flutter analyze

cd rust && cargo test
```

Reviewing a quote calls the configured 1Click/proxy quote API and can return a
real one-time deposit instruction. Reviewing a quote does not move funds by
itself. Starting a ZEC-to-external swap sends the software-wallet deposit by
default; hardware-wallet accounts wait for Keystone signing.

After changing Rust API files in `rust/src/api/`, regenerate bindings from the
repo root:

```bash
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
```

## Support Vizor

If Vizor is useful to you, consider supporting its continued development with
a ZEC donation.
